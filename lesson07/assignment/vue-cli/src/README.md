Topic: Domain Authority https://moz.com/blog/domain-authority-seo

Domain authority is used to PREDICT how well your link stacks against others.
This is an interesting concept since it has nothing to do with Google and Google
hates it when you ask them about it. Things like key work targeting and on-page
content determines how well your page is ranked.

For me, if I were to make something with a high ranking, I would probably try to
come up with my own social media website or search engine (easier said than done).
It would have to be something used a lot for a high ranking and have good content.

As for my project, I would make sure to use proper H1 tags for one page at a time,
and the domain name is a good name and not used a lot by others but is interesting.
